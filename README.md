# ES6 Basics
# ALX Back end Specialization Task on JavaScript

This repository covers fundamental concepts of ECMAScript 6 (ES6), also known as ECMAScript 2015, in JavaScript. Below is a brief overview of the topics covered:
## Statements and Declarations

ES6 introduced several new features for statements and declarations, including let and const for block-scoped variables, as well as class for defining classes in a more intuitive and structured manner.
## Arrow Functions

Arrow functions provide a concise syntax for writing anonymous functions in JavaScript. They are especially useful for writing inline functions with a shorter syntax.
## Default Parameters
ES6 allows function parameters to have default values. This feature enables developers to define default values for parameters if they are not explicitly provided when the function is called.

## Rest Parameter
The rest parameter syntax (...) allows a function to accept an indefinite number of arguments as an array, providing a more flexible way to handle function parameters.

## Iterables and Iterators
ES6 introduced the concept of iterables and iterators, which enable easy traversal and manipulation of data structures like arrays and objects using the for...of loop and other iterator methods.

# Usage
This repository includes examples and explanations for each of these topics to help you understand and practice ES6 concepts effectively.
Feel free to explore the code examples and experiment with them to deepen your understanding of ES6 features.
